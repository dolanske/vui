    <h1>CSS framework</h1>
    <p>
      The VUI CSS framework provides essential utility classes for common styling needs.
      It's designed to eliminate the need for external CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS by
      providing the bare minimum utilities you need in 99% of cases.
    </p>

    <h3>When to use</h3>
    <p>
      Use the CSS framework <strong>sparsely</strong> in these scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Components aren't sufficient:</strong> When the component library can't achieve your styling needs</li>
      <li><strong>One-off styling:</strong> When creating a dedicated CSS class would be overkill</li>
      <li><strong>Quick adjustments:</strong> Primarily for spacing and typography tweaks</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
