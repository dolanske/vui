    <h1>Style tokens</h1>
    <p>VUI stores all styling properties in CSS variables. This ensures consistency across application as well as support in all styling languages, as CSS variables are tech-agnostic and all parsers support them.</p>
    <p>Each token group also contains its CSS class counterpart and will link to it. Here's a link to the <NuxtLink href="/docs/framework">CSS framework</NuxtLink>.</p>
