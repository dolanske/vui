    <h1>Style Tokens</h1>
    <p>VUI uses CSS custom properties (variables) to manage all styling properties. This approach ensures consistent design across your application while maintaining compatibility with all styling languages, as CSS variables are technology-agnostic and universally supported by all CSS parsers.</p>
    <p>
      Each token group includes its corresponding CSS class implementation and provides a direct link to it. For more information about how these tokens are used in our framework, visit the <NuxtLink href="/docs/framework">
