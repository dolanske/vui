# Fix generated component page

Read, analyze and understand how is structured. The markdown documentation follows these basic rules

1. Title & description
2. Example component built on (/docs/Example.vue) which contains an interactive example and the code it was used in. Look at <file2> for reference
3. Sections for props, events, slots, exposes etc. All of these sections contain tables whose structure is strictly defined. Please reference the component documentation above
4. Additional (code-only) example for more advanced uses. Often only 1, but very complex component can have more examples.

Now, restructure & update the <file3> based on these rules. It is of utomost importance that the newly written file follows the structure of the example file and the provided list of rules.
