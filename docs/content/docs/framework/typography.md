# Typography

VUI comes with some [pre-defined HTML styles](https://github.com/dolanske/vui/blob/main/src/style/typography.scss).

When you use an `article` element or apply the `.typeset` class, these base styles are enhanced with additional spacing and layout rules to create a more polished reading experience for content-heavy pages.

Below is a **generated** example article meant to showcase VUI's typography setup:

# Building Modern UI

Modern user interface development has evolved significantly over the past decade, with **component-based architecture** becoming the standard approach for creating _scalable_ and maintainable applications. This methodology addresses the fundamental challenges of building consistent, accessible, and performant user experiences.

## The Philosophy Behind Modern UI Development

At its core, modern UI development follows principles of **reusability and consistency**. Effective UI systems provide developers with:

- Modular components that can be reused across different contexts
  - Component libraries for consistency
  - Design tokens for unified styling
  - Documentation for proper usage
- Consistent design patterns that create predictable user experiences
  - Navigation patterns
  - Form interactions
  - Loading states
- Accessibility considerations built into every interface element
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Color contrast compliance
- Performance optimizations that enhance user satisfaction

### Component Architecture

Modern UI architecture is built around three fundamental concepts:

1. **Modularity**: Each component encapsulates its own logic and styling
   - Isolated CSS scoping
   - Self-contained functionality
   - Clear component boundaries
2. **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces
   - Flexible prop interfaces
   - Slot-based content injection
   - Event-driven communication
3. **Customization**: Components accept configuration options for different use cases

When implementing modern UI components, developers typically follow patterns like this:

```vue
<template>
  <button
    class="btn" :class="[`btn--${variant}`, `btn--${size}`]"
    :disabled="disabled"
  >
    <slot />
  </button>
</template>
```

This approach demonstrates how components can be designed to be both flexible and consistent, providing clear APIs while maintaining visual harmony.

### Color Systems

Effective color systems provide semantic meaning and visual hierarchy. A well-designed color palette typically includes:

| Color Type | Purpose              | Common Usage               |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Primary    | Brand identity       | Call-to-action buttons     |
| Secondary  | Supporting actions   | Secondary buttons, links   |
| Neutral    | Content hierarchy    | Text, backgrounds, borders |
| Semantic   | Status communication | Success, warning, error    |

### Typography Hierarchy

Typography systems establish clear information hierarchy and improve readability:

<dl>
  <dt>Font Scale</dt>
  <dd>Mathematical progression ensuring proportional relationships between text sizes</dd>

  <dt>Line Height</dt>
  <dd>Optimal spacing for readability, typically 1.4-1.6 for body text</dd>

  <dt>Font Weight</dt>
  <dd>Strategic use of weight to establish emphasis and hierarchy</dd>

  <dt>Letter Spacing</dt>
  <dd>Fine-tuning character spacing for optimal readability</dd>

  <dt>Font Pairing</dt>
  <dd>Combining typefaces that complement each other for visual harmony</dd>
</dl>

### Spacing Systems

Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and improves usability:

- Use mathematical progressions (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- Establish clear relationships between related elements
- Maintain consistent patterns across all components

## Implementation Strategies

### Getting Started

Beginning a UI project requires careful planning and setup:

```bash
# Choose appropriate tooling
npm create vue@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

Establish your design system early:

```css
/* Define design tokens */
:root {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-secondary: #7c3aed;
  --spacing-unit: 4px;
  --border-radius: 6px;
}
```

### Best Practices

When building modern UIs, consider these principles:

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
2. **Accessibility First**: Ensure all users can interact with your interface
   - Use proper heading hierarchy
   - Provide alternative text for images
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, then enhance
   - Start with working HTML
   - Add CSS for visual enhancement
   - Include JavaScript for interactivity
4. **Performance Budget**: Monitor and optimize loading times and runtime performance
5. **Testing Strategy**: Test across devices, browsers, and user scenarios

## Conclusion

Modern UI development is about creating **consistent**, _accessible_, and ~~complex~~ intuitive interfaces that serve users effectively. By following established patterns and principles, developers can build applications that are both beautiful and functional.

The emphasis on **systematic thinking**, _reusable components_, and user-centered design ensures that modern interfaces can scale with growing product requirements while maintaining quality and usability.

Understanding these fundamentals provides the foundation for building any type of user interface, regardless of the specific tools or frameworks chosen for implementation.
